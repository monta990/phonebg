## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-08

### Added
- Configuration page now uses Bootstrap tabs: **Plantilla** (upload/delete) and **Posiciones** (position editor), matching GLPI's native tab style.
- Preview button in Phone asset tab opens a modal with the generated wallpaper inline before downloading.
- `download.php` supports `?preview=1` parameter to serve the PNG inline (`Content-Disposition: inline`).

### Fixed
- Drag-and-drop position editor: labels are now fully draggable without accidentally selecting or dragging the background image (`pointer-events:none` on `<img>`, `draggable="false"`, `user-select:none` on container).
- Position editor image is now displayed at its real pixel dimensions (no `max-height` constraint); the outer container scrolls if needed.
- Draggable labels initialize at the correct position on page load, reading saved X/Y values from the plugin configuration.

### Changed
- Folder distributed as `phonebg` (no suffix).
- Plugin logo redesigned: phone icon with a landscape wallpaper in the foreground, transparent background, no text. Replaces the previous blue-background version.
- README updated to display the logo as a centered header in both English and Spanish sections, and reflects all v1.2.0 features.

## [1.1.0] — 2025-03-08 *(unreleased — changes merged into v1.2.0)*

### Added
- **Visual position editor** in the settings page: drag-and-drop labels directly over the template preview to position device name and line number text.
- **`PluginPhonebgConfig` class** (`inc/config.class.php`): DB-backed layout configuration stored in `glpi_plugin_phonebg_config`. Survives plugin upgrades.
- **Per-field controls**: font size (px), X coordinate, Y coordinate, and font color (`<input type="color">`) for each text field.
- **X = 0 auto-center**: setting X to 0 horizontally centers the text regardless of image width (previous default behavior is now explicitly configurable).
- **Reset to defaults** button: restores all position and style settings to factory values without deleting the template.
- Positions and font color are now read from the database at generation time instead of being hard-coded.
- Inputs in the position table stay in sync with drag movements in real time.
- `plugin_phonebg_uninstall()` now drops the `glpi_plugin_phonebg_config` table on uninstall.
- `imagepng()` now uses compression level 6 for consistently smaller generated files (~30 % size reduction).
- README rewritten in English and Spanish (both in the same file).
- New `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed
- `background.class.php`: `drawCenteredText()` replaced by `drawText()` which accepts an explicit X coordinate (0 = auto-center).
- `setup.php`: version bumped to `1.1.0`; `plugin_phonebg_install()` calls `PluginPhonebgConfig::createTable()`.
- `phone.class.php`: removed stale commented-out `require_once` line.
- `config.form.php`: removed unused `global $CFG_GLPI` declaration.

### Locales
- 12 new translatable strings added across all four locales (es_MX, en_US, en_GB, fr_FR).
- All `.po` and `.mo` files updated to version 1.1.0 with 43 strings total.

## [1.0.1] — 2025-03-08

### Changed
- Version bumped to `1.0.1` in `setup.php` and `README.md`.

## [1.0.0] — 2025-02-26

### Added
- Initial release.
- Generates personalized PNG wallpapers for GLPI Phone assets using a custom PNG template.
- Overlays phone name and assigned line number (from `glpi_items_lines`) onto the template using GD + DejaVu Sans TTF.
- **Phone asset tab** ("Background") with a download button; button is disabled if no template has been uploaded.
- **Admin settings page** (`front/config.form.php`): upload template (PNG, max 500 KB), preview before saving, delete current template.
- `resource.send.php`: authenticated endpoint that serves the template image; sends HTTP cache headers (`ETag`, `Last-Modified`, `Cache-Control`) and handles `304 Not Modified`.
- `download.php`: generates the wallpaper PNG on demand and streams it as a file download; temp file is always deleted in a `finally` block.
- `PluginPhonebgPaths` class: centralized path and URL resolution supporting both `plugins/` and `marketplace/` installation directories.
- `PluginPhonebgBackground::checkRequirements()`: validates GD extension, template file, and TTF font before attempting generation.
- Auto-shrink logic: font size starts at 60 px and decreases until the device name fits within the image width minus 40 px margin.
- CSRF protection on all POST forms (`$PLUGIN_HOOKS['csrf_compliant']`).
- MIME type validation via `finfo` (not file extension).
- File size limit: 500 KB for template uploads.
- Filename sanitization in `Content-Disposition` headers (`preg_replace`).
- XSS escaping with `htmlspecialchars` for all user-visible phone names.
- Concurrent download safety: temp file names include `uniqid()` suffix.
- `Session::checkLoginUser()` on all front endpoints; `Session::checkRight('config', UPDATE)` on the settings page.
- Full i18n support: es_MX, en_US, en_GB, fr_FR — POT template + compiled `.mo` files.
- `README.md` and `LICENSE` (GPLv2).
